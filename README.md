# JavaFX-GUI  
The reason I designed my GUI with an HBox at the top of the borderpane was that when all the controls were anywhere else, the canvas  
looked very clustered. The Drawable shape interface allows for easy scaling if there were ever to be another shape added, along with the   
drawingController class that keeps up with any shapes and gets the area with a binded label.   
Feature Overview:  
The features I included in my GUI were the two radio buttons and a clear button that also function with keyboard input. There is also a counter that keeps   
up with the shapes and the total area of all the shapes combined.
