TO RUN, TYPE IN TERMINAL:
mvn javafx:run

level 1: 

Created 3 classes - main, circle and rectangle. Rectangle and Circle define the shapes and main builds the GUI and uses the shape classes to draw the shape specified in the with the radio buttons. Added a button to clear the canvas. 

AI: 

Used Copilot to help me implement the interactable features (helping me figure out syntax and where to add radio buttons, clear canvas.) Had it refactor my code to run correctly when I had issues with using the classes I made in main. Asked it design and implementation questions to ensure my code is set up properly and easily read.
